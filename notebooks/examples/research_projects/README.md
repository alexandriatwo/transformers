# Research projects

This folder contains various research projects using ðŸ¤— Transformers. They are not maintained and require a specific version of ðŸ¤— Transformers that is indicated in the requirements file of each folder. Updating them to the most recent version of the library will require some work.

To use any of them, just run the command

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

inside the folder of your choice.

If you need help with any of those, contact the author\(s\), indicated at the top of the `README` of each folder.
